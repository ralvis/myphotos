							<h2>Big Old Burrus</h2>
							<p>This picture captures the iconic building at Virginia Tech, Burruss Hall. This building has a very central location on campus and holds the office of the president of the university, the office of the VP of admissions and a concert hall with over 3000 seats. The photo is staged to show the massive height and stature of Burrus, representing its importance to our campus.</p>

							<h2>Fire in the Sky</h2>
							<p>One day I came back to my apartment after a long day on campus and when I reached the top of the stairs, it looked as though the sky had caught on fire. The blue and red tones lit up the sky for the final few moments of daylight. I snapped a picture before the sun set, the colors went away and the fire went out leaving darkness to take over the night.</p>

							<h2>Road to the Sky</h2>
							<p>As I ran through the residential neighborhoods of Blacksburg I sighed at the bottom of the hill the road looked like it went straight up into the sky. One step in front of the other I ran up the hill pretending at the top I would be among the clouds.</p>

							<h2>Island in the Pond</h2>
							<p>TThe pond featured above is known by Virginia Tech students as the Duck Pond. It has also been voted Blacksburg's number one cheapest and most romantic date. I think the Duck Pond date is too mainstream so I challenge anyone who sees this post to attempt to take their significant other on a date to the island in the middle of the Duck Pond.</p>

							<h2>Team Meeting</h2>
							<p>You know when you see sorority girls giggling in the library about their favorite new frat boy? This is the duck equivalent.</p>

							<h2>The Lonely Duckling </h2>
							<p>This poor duck stood alone on the side of the Duck Pond. Has he lost all of his friends? Maybe he is taking a minute out of the day for himself? Maybe he just had an itch on his shoulder he wanted to take care of in private? I feel bad for the lonely duckling, I hope he finds his friends!</p>

							<h2>Pop of Pink</h2>
							<p>This flower reminds me of a lot of people. It reminds me of the people who aren’t afraid to stand out, be bold and have fun even when their surroundings may not encourage it. </p>

							<h2>Protectors of the Pylons</h2>
							<p>These fantastic statues represent the values Virginia Tech students strive to live by each and every day. They watch over our campus 24/7 from the pylons reminding students to be the best versions of themselves.</p>

							<h2>Rainy Tuesday</h2>
							<p>My friend and I went for a walk one Tuesday. It was a cool fall day in Blacksburg, the sky its usual grey color. All of a sudden the grey sky opened up and beads of rain came pelting down on us. We ran to the car giggling and screaming the whole way, when we arrived we jumped in soaked from head to toe. As we sat in the car still laughing, the rain continued to drip around us, peacefully pelting to the ground.</p>

							<h2>Hanging Buckets of Sunshine</h2>
							<p>To combat the usual grey sky that on occasion can consume Blacksburg, the city decided to protest and hang these buckets of sunshine around campus and downtown. I appreciate the city doing everything they can to continue to make Blacksburg and Virginia Tech the best places on the planet!  *WARNING: this is not fact*</p>

							<h2>Old Man Tree</h2>
							<p>This tree reminds me of an old man. It seems wise, for each branch he grew he gained information and knowledge. I also think it reminded me of an old man because it is covered in wrinkles.</p>

									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>Hello everyone! As most of you may know, my name is Riley! I was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia and I went a small all-girls school called St. Catherines High School. I am thankful to have graduated (and survived) from STC and I am proud to now be a sophomore at Virginia Tech majoring in Public Relations with a minor in Marketing! I am involved with many organizations on campus such as PRSSA, Hokie Ambassadors, Chocolate Milk Mondays and my sorority Sigma Kappa! </p>
									<p>This semester I am enrolled in a class called Visual Media. Throughout the semester I have been challenged creatively and I have learned lots of new skills. This class has helped me come closer to figuring out what I really want to do when I graduate from Virginia Tech and enter the real world. One of our projects was to take pictures that we believed captured the essence of Fall in Blacksburg. </p>
									<p>I have gathered 11 images that I took around Virginia Tech’s campus and downtown Blacksburg that I believe capture the theme of Fall. I have captioned each with some fun facts about Virginia Tech, witty jokes and short stories that I hope might make you laugh. I really enjoyed this project because I got to explore and learn more about the town that has become my home. I hope you enjoy the images I have gathered for you and I hope for those of you far away from me that this gives you a better lense into where I live!</p>
									<p>For those of you who want to continue to keep up with me please follow my social media linked below! </p>
